# E-Mart

Welcome to the E-mart project! This is a web application built using React, designed to simulate an online marketplace where users can browse, search for products, add them to their cart, and complete purchases.

1.Product Catalog: 
          The application displays a catalog of products, including images, names, and prices. Users can browse through the catalog, filter products based on categories or                            search for specific items.
2. Shopping Cart: 
          Users can add products to their cart, adjust quantities, and remove items as needed. The shopping cart provides a summary of selected items and their total cost.         
3.Checkout Process: 
          Once users are satisfied with their selection, they can proceed to checkout. The checkout process collects necessary information such as shipping address and payment details                before confirming the order.       

Technologies Used:
React: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Redux: Redux is used for state management, enabling efficient data flow and centralized state management across the application.
React Router: React Router is used for declarative routing, allowing the application to navigate between different views based on the URL.
Bootstrap: Bootstrap is used for styling and responsive design, ensuring the application looks great and works well on various devices and screen sizes.
